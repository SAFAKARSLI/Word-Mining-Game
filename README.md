# Word-Mining-Game

- In this game you will be needing 3 players, 2 to play 1 to guide (to be admin). After the game chooses which one of the players is going to goes first, you will see a table fully with letters picked randomly up by a computer. All you need to win the game is to create words by using given letters. Of course, a longer word means more score. The game will continue until both players gave up or made mistakes 3 times. If one of the players gave up, the other player will keep playing until he or she gave up or reach the allowed mistake limit. Which player finds the longest word, his or her score will multiply by 1.5 end of the game.
